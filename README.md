# Ross

navigate to a directory and use the images like a gallery.
this uses intervals. the first few images are only shown for a few seconds. each interval increases in time.

```bash
$ cd images-to-draw/
$ ross
```
ross opens up the images and runs in the browser

## to-do / future things
an option to iterate through images sequentially. will be set to random for now
  - files might be named "image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", etc
